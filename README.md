###Compatible javadoc
___
The course is **compatible with the older version** of BURLAP **2.1.x**. **[Here's][1]** the corresponding **javadoc**.

The above documentation might still be slightely different if you are using **2.1.2** like me. In that case it would be better to generate your own javadoc from the [source code][2] by running the ant task on the branch 2.1.2.
